This API is "work in progress", its not pretty, it might not even be all that usefull or understandable.
But it will allow you to make plugins for Equalify.

To get it working you need visual studio (or atleast Visual C++) 2010

* Create a new WIN32 Project
* In the wizard click next(NOT FINISH!)
* Select DLL and EMPTY PROJECT
* Copy the source files to your project folder and add them to the project

It should now compile fine.


To use it you have to use the Equalify DLL that is provided in the binary folder.
Copy that dll to the folders listed here: http://www.equalify.me/?page=path

# more will be added....
